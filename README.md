# Odin Recipes
The Odin Project Foundational Course First HTML Assignment

This project is meant to help develop the basic HTML skills needed to continue further into The Odin Project Foundational Course.

The assignment was to create a recipes website.

This exercise let me create multiple pages through html files and link them, eventualy creating a functional, if a little bare, website.

It also showed how easy it is to publish from github itself. For static websites, this is a very simple yet powerful tool.

Lets start with the basics of css and eventually come back here!
